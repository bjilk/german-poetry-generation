# German poetry generation

This is my final project for the course **TDT4310 - Intelligent Text Analytics and Language Understanding** at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in the summer semester of 2022.

The aim of this project is to use the [German Poetry Corpus (DLK)](https://github.com/tnhaider/DLK) to train a language model capable to generate new poems.
